Designed an implemented the Ford Thunderbird turn signal which requires, left turn, right turn, and hazards. The below image shows the back of the car and as well how the turn signals will light up during the signaling process. This was implemented on an FPGA and demonstrated on the FPGAs on-board LEDs.
